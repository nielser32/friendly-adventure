Repository conventions:
- Use npm workspaces (`npm run dev:web`, `npm run dev:api`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`) from the repo root.
- Keep TypeScript strict across workspaces and prefer schema validation for any inbound/outbound payloads.
- Follow accessibility, performance, and UX best practices from the listed checklists for UI-facing changes.
- Keep documentation up to date when adding features (README sections or workspace-level docs).
